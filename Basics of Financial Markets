Here is a concise extraction of the **Basics of Financial Markets** focusing on the overview of primary vs. secondary markets and money markets vs. capital markets:

### Basics of Financial Markets

- **Primary Market vs. Secondary Market**  
  - The **primary market** is where new securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) are created and issued for the first time, typically through mechanisms like Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). Companies and governments raise capital directly from investors in this market.  
  - The **secondary market** is where these already issued securities are traded among investors. It provides liquidity and enables investors to buy and sell securities without involving the issuing company. Examples include stock exchanges like the NYSE and NASDAQ.  
  - The primary market facilitates capital raising for growth and development, while the secondary market enhances market efficiency through liquidity and price discovery.

- **Money Markets vs. Capital Markets**  
  - **Money markets** deal with short-term debt instruments, typically with maturities of one year or less. These instruments are low risk and provide liquidity for short-term funding needs.  
  - **Capital markets** involve long-term debt and equity instruments, such as stocks and bonds, which are used to finance longer-term investments and growth. Capital markets can be further divided into primary and secondary markets as described above.
