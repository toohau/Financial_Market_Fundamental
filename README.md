# Module 1 Key Points Summary

## Overview
- Introduction to the relevance of financial markets in everyday life and the critical role of ethical judgment in finance.  
- Establishes foundational knowledge on risk evaluation, insurance history, portfolio management, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).

## Key Concepts
- **Ethical Judgments in Finance:** Importance of trust, transparency, and integrity in financial decision-making to maintain market stability and investor confidence.  
- **Sources of Risk:** Understanding individual security risks and portfolio-level risk evaluation methods such as diversification and Value at Risk (VaR).  
- **Disaster Risk:** Identification of extreme, rare events impacting investments beyond normal market fluctuations.  
- **Insurance History and Structure:** Key milestones in insurance development and differences between state and national insurance systems in the U.S.  
- **Risk Distributions:** Differences between normal and fat-tail distributions and their implications for risk pooling, moral hazard, and selection bias.  
- **Risk Diversification:** Principle that spreading investments reduces unsystematic risk.  
- **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):** Framework explaining the relationship between expected return and systematic risk (beta), including the role of short-selling.  
- **Efficient Frontier:** Concept in portfolio management representing optimal portfolios offering the highest return for a given risk.

   - Examples of risk pooling, moral hazard, and selection bias in insurance and finance.  
6. **Portfolio Theory and CAPM**  
   - Computing optimal risk-return portfolios.  
   - Understanding beta and the efficient frontier.  
   - Role of short-selling in CAPM and portfolio optimization.

## Important Definitions
- **Ethical Judgment:** Applying honesty, fairness, and legal compliance in financial decisions.  
- **Disaster Risk:** Rare, extreme events causing significant financial loss beyond normal market volatility.  
- **Moral Hazard:** When a party insulated from risk behaves differently than if fully exposed to the risk.  
- **Selection Bias:** Distortion caused by non-random selection of participants or data.  
- **Beta:** Measure of a securityâ€™s sensitivity to market movements in CAPM.
