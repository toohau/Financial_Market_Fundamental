### Module 2 Key Points Summary

#### Lesson 5: Innovation and Risk Management

- Innovation and invention are slow, iterative processes requiring time and support from social and legal institutions.
- Intellectual exchanges (such as salons) historically helped foster innovation.
- Limited liability protects investors by capping their financial losses, encouraging investment and entrepreneurship.
- Inflation-indexed debt instruments protect both borrowers and lenders from inflation risk by adjusting payments according to inflation.
- The Unidad de Fomento in Chile is an example of an inflation-indexed unit of account used to stabilize financial contracts.
- Real estate risk management includes financial products like equity-protected mortgages that help shield homeowners from housing market risks.


#### Lesson 6: Forecasting and Market Efficiency

- Forecasting often relies on heuristics, which can lead to biases in predictions.
- The Efficient Market Hypothesis states that asset prices quickly reflect all available information.
- Prices are understood as Present Discounted Values (PDV) of expected future cash flows.
- Market efficiency can be questioned during crises or when narratives strongly influence investor behavior.


#### Lesson 7: Behavioral Finance

- Human behavior and cognitive biases significantly impact financial decision-making.
- Prospect Theory explains that individuals weigh losses more heavily than equivalent gains and may misjudge probabilities.
- Common biases include framing effects, magical thinking, and confirmation bias.
- Some personality disorders may influence financial decisions.
- Behavioral finance challenges the notion of perfectly rational investors, showing how emotions and psychological factors create market anomalies.


#### Honors Module

- Reinforces the concept of limited liability as a mechanism to protect shareholders.
- Highlights inflation risk as a key uncertainty affecting purchasing power.
- Introduces human capital risk, showing that future earnings (human capital) are also at risk.
